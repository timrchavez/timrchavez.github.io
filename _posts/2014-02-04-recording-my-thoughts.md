I attempted to start a blog at [Tumblr](http://timrcc.tumblr.com) in 2010
right after joining Canonical, I never formed a blogging habbit, and that
effort eventually failed.  Part of the reason I think this happened had 
to do with the fact that I was not really working on anything terribly
interesting at work and most of my off time was being spent learning how 
to be a dad (which I am still leaning, by the way).  A lot has changed
between 2010 and 2014.  For one, I feel like I am working on some pretty
interesting at work (at least for someone who enjoys release engineering,
continuous integration, and software delivery pipelines) that I would love
to write about.  Additionally, I have refound some of my coding mojo and am
currently working on a couple apps outside of work that I would like to blog
about.  I have also started playing around with arduinos and would rather 
make this blog a point of origin for those adventures that I can share with
all my other social networks.

This time around I have chosen to use my [GitHub](http://github.com) User Page + 
[Jekyll-Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/). My sincere hope is that by using
a blog self-contained in a git repo, I will eliminate a lot of the friction I faced
with other blogging software.  Specifically, WYSIWYG editors, and web interfaces in
general.  They either get in my way because they suck or I get hung up on presentation 
issues while at that moment in time I should be focused on finishing a thought.  
By using Markdown to write posts, I can produce the content in the editor of my choice 
with little fuss and use formatting cues in place of actual formatting.  Storing the 
blog in a git repo also has some built-in advantages.  For exampe, I can make quick 
edits, revert changes, and create drafts using a workflow that I am already familiar 
with as a developer.  The fact that the [blog is also hosted](https://github.com/timrchavez/timrchavez.github.io) 
on [GitHub](http://github.com) has benefits as well.  For example, it allows other 
people to raise issues and / or submit pull requests to fix issues on the blog if they 
so choose.

So while I cannot guarantee that this blog will contain quality content, I hope I have 
taken the necessary steps to ensure it will at least have content :)
