I attempted to start a blog at [Tumblr](http://timrcc.tumblr.com) in 2010
right after joining [Canonical](http://www.canonical.com), but I never formed 
a blogging habbit, and that effort eventually failed.  Part of the reason 
I think this happened had to do with the fact that I was not really doing 
anything terribly interesting Canonical at the time and most of my off time
was being spent learning how to be a new dad.  Enough has changed between 2010 
and 2014, though, that I the urge to start blogging again.  For one, I find that
I am currently working on some pretty interesting stuff at Canonical that I would 
like to blog about.  My family has also finally found a routine that works and it 
has given me back some of my free time to work on personal projects and I would 
like to blog about those as well.

This time around I have chosen to use my [GitHub](http://github.com) User Page + 
[Jekyll-Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/). My sincere hope is that by using
a blog self-contained in a git repo, I will eliminate a lot of the friction I faced
with other blogging software.  Specifically, WYSIWYG editors, and web interfaces in
general.  They either get in my way because they suck or I get hung up on presentation 
issues while at that moment in time I should be focused on finishing a thought.  
By using Markdown to write posts, I can produce the content in the editor of my choice 
with little fuss and use formatting cues in place of actual formatting.  Storing the 
blog in a git repo also has some built-in advantages.  For exampe, I can make quick 
edits, revert changes, and create drafts using a workflow that I am already familiar 
with as a developer.  The fact that the [blog is also hosted](https://github.com/timrchavez/timrchavez.github.io) 
on [GitHub](http://github.com) has benefits as well.  For example, it allows other 
people to raise issues and / or submit pull requests to fix issues on the blog if they 
so choose.

So while I cannot guarantee that this blog will have quality content, I hope I have 
taken the necessary steps to ensure it will at least have content :)
