I thought I would attempt to start recording some of my thoughts in a blog
again.  This time around I have decided to use my [GitHub](http://github.com)
User Page + [Jekyll](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/).  My sincere hope is to
not only make this blog a little more permanent than my pior attempt at 
[Tumblr](http://tumblr.com), but to update it regularly with some of the 
neat stuff I am doing at work as well as some of the neat stuff I am doing 
outside of work.  Well... what I consider neat, at least :)
